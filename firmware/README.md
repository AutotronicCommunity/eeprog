This version of the firmware uses the Arduino core for the ATtiny84 from
[here](https://github.com/damellis/attiny/). Starting the project with an
incomplete version of my new Microbe library was a bad move in hindsight -
rather than divert energy to working on the library right now the Arduino
core should get me up and running a bit faster.
